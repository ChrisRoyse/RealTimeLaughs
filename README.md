# ClipItLive: Real-Time Twitch Laugh Detection and Stream Clipping

ClipItLive is an innovative tool that captures real-time chat data across Twitch and automatically clips the most recent 20 seconds of a stream whenever someone in the chat laughs. Designed to monitor thousands of live channels simultaneously, ClipItLive detects laughter in chat messages and generates highlights of the funniest moments happening across the Twitch platform. The system queues these clips and plays the most recent highlights, providing an uninterrupted stream of humor across 100,000+ active channels.

# Key Features:

Real-Time Chat Monitoring: Tracks chat messages across 100,000+ live Twitch channels in real time.

Laugh Detection: Automatically detects laughter from chat messages using keyword detection and triggers clip creation.

Instant Highlight Creation: Captures the last 20 seconds of the stream where laughter was detected.

Queue System: Clips are queued up and played, showing the latest moments of humor across Twitch.

Scalable: Capable of monitoring and reacting to chats from thousands of streams simultaneously.

# How It Works:

The system captures Twitch chat data in real time.

It listens for laughter or humor-related messages in the chat.

When detected, the system sends a trigger to another service to create a 20-second clip of the stream leading up to the laugh.

These clips are then queued and displayed, providing viewers with a continuous stream of real-time, user-validated highlights from across the platform.
